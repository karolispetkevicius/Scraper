With more than 65 built-in policy detections, Theta Lake empowers organizations to identify and mitigate data loss, security, acceptable use, and compliance risks in what was shared within any Slack conversation, with the option to create custom detections as well.Existing supervision practices typically only focus on the text within Slack collaboration, which leaves a blind spot when it comes to files, audio recordings, video recordings, or any other rich media shared through this channel. Theta Lake helps organizations take a holistic approach to review, analyzing 100% of shared content to identify potential data loss or compliance risks. Powered by state-of-the-art deep learning and AI, Theta Lake points reviewers to a specific event within a message thread that requires further investigation.Slack conversations and all attachments are reviewable in their native threaded format, including 1:1, group, and team channel instant messages. Each conversation is issued a risk score, all participants are identified (even inactive participants), and any policy detections on the content are flagged for reviewers. Additionally, reviewers can view messages that have been deleted and edited by the participants across any conversation and channel, as well as directly remove content from the conversation within the Slack channels. This includes risky URLs that could pose a security threat or any content that violates acceptable use and conduct policies.Use Theta Lake as your archive of record and securely preserve Slack content within our SOC2 Type 2-certified, SEC 17a-4 compliant archive. Specifically designed for collaboration platform storage, Theta Lake enables legal and compliance teams to perform rich eDiscovery and legal hold case management across messages and content shared.

Create a channel specifically for NPS or see a data rich preview when you paste any Pendo link in Slack. Who’s it for?Companies with Pendo, who also communicate and collaborate with Slack Product teams who want to share insights, but know not everyone will use Pendo CPO’s and CEO’s who want to build a customer first business, that takes customer feedback seriously. Pricing and Packaging? Slack is a free integration and does not count towards a customers integrations limit.  Why is the Slack integration valuable? There are two big components to this integration. The first are Slack preview links. Once authorized, any Pendo link pasted into Slack will now come with a data rich preview of what it’s linking too (unfurl links). Users will see Slack link previews when links to specific analytics or guides are shared. This allows you and your colleagues to benefit from Pendo insights at a glance, without having to jump into the app, unless you want to. Even more data awaits you there.  Get started with Slack link previews here. The second is Pendo NPS for Slack. This allows you to see real-time NPS responses directly in Slack. You can send NPS submissions to a channel of your choice. Then, configure custom metadata for more informative summaries to help you act on the responses. Customer feedback is a gift, but if you can’t act on it it’s hard to benefit from it. Having a dedicated NPS Slack channel puts that feedback into the hands of everyone at your company, where it can become a real resource.      Get started with Pendo NPS for Slack here. Requirements Slack is a free integration, and available for all packages of Pendo. You will need the following permissions to authorize Slack.Admin permission to your Slack account  Admin permission to your Pendo account Note: This authentication is only required one time from one Pendo Admin (+Slack Admin) for your Slack instance at this time. This means once the integration is set up, only one Pendo user needs to authenticate in Slack so any user can see the unfurled information from Pendo links in any Slack channel."},

What's more, many organizations grant access privileges to users outside their SSO processes.This security blind spot can expose you to the theft of proprietary data.

The app will always return results in the English language, but use other language models if a story is in another language.It's free, thanks to the support of the Reynolds Journalism Fellowship program at the University of Missouri :tiger:The core experience is around two main commands. First is /analyze - the idea being input any URL and we’ll find it, apply the language models, apply the trends data to those keywords and give you that data to help make better choices. Similarly, what if my story was before publishing? I could use the /prep command and enter my story in. This is agnostic to any CMS since all you need to do is copy and paste your text and it will do the rest.  We’re proving the density of your keywords to your story headline and description.  How loosely or tightly related are the most prominent keywords to each item?It's all in service of getting it right the first time, which is what we want most from our journalism.Disclaimer: YESEO utilizes artificial intelligence (AI) to generate data.

Seeking and giving voluntary feedback builds generosity in the system and helps build such a culture. Also, our colleagues, who we spend most of our day time with, are the best people to give advice / feedback on our strengths and opportunities, thereby allowing us to plan our development goals and embark on a journey of self-improvement.360Katas is built to enable team members seek continuous feedback and use this to work on development goals by joining a learning group (coming soon) of like-minded people, thereby helping enhance employee engagement, work culture, and employee productivity.FAQs:---------1. We already use a HR software which has a module for performance appraisals, why do we need 360Katas?360Katas can be used to seek 360 degree feedback from peers, managers, and reportees similar to what is done during a performance appraisal. However, 360Katas is unique in that it is used primarily to seek continuous feedback, commissioned by the individual and not part of the performance review conducted by the company! Also, we are laser focussed only on getting individuals insightful feedback and helping them act on it, unlike traditional tools like Lattice, Abot, HeyTaco, Polly, or other HR Apps, in which feedback is only a feature!2. Why anonymous feedback? Doesn’t it attract negative comments?We believe anonymous feedback helps arrest human biases and enable individuals to act purely on the feedback received. In 360Katas, anonymous feedback is sought only from a closed set of people with each respondent aware of this fact, and hence negativity is usually avoided. We elaborated our thoughts further in this article.3. How it Works:- Just tap on Start in the App Home- Select the people you want anonymous feedback from and edit the questions if needed- The selected recipients will get a message from 360Katas to respond to the feedback request- Once sufficient responses are received, you will be notified to review the feedbackThrough the same flow, managers can run an anonymous employee satisfaction survey, pulse survey, or feedback on organization culture!\"A year from now you may wish you had started today.\"- Karen Lamb"},

From consulting firms to marketing agencies to IT outsourcers, Ruddr helps you run a better services business.Ruddr captures all operational data related to clients, projects, tasks, time, expenses, and invoices. Ruddr then surfaces key insights into that data via dashboards, reports, and Key Performance Indicators (KPIs). Additionally, Ruddr continuously monitors your portfolio of projects and identifies exception conditions such as missing time entries or outstanding time/expense approvals.Ruddr was designed from the ground-up to leverage the power of Slack. Common features in Ruddr, such as time tracking, can be accessed directly within Slack. Users do not have to context switch between applications. Ruddr also leverages Slack for real-time notifications to individuals and project teams.How is Ruddr different than its competitors?• Ruddr was designed for the modern distributed workforce. Professional services team members can be spread out across the globe. They may be at client sites, working from home, in transit, or at the office. By integrating with modern tools for distributed teams (such as Slack), Ruddr helps you maintain productivity and performance from any location.• Ruddr is built for the SMB professional services team. One of the problems with professional services software is that it can get complex and convoluted. Software built for the enterprise is overkill for the SMB community. Ruddr is right-sized for the SMB services operation.• Ruddr has a world-class user experience (UX). Professional services software is notorious for having a poor user experience. From the design to user interaction, Ruddr has been built to provide an intuitive and pleasing experience.• Ruddr is your copilot. Ruddr is continuously monitoring your portfolio of projects and proactively identifying trouble spots often before your team notices them. This helps inform strategic business decisions, stabilizes financial performance, and improves organizational scalability.What are some of the main features?• Best-of-breed time tracking. One reason consultants hate professional services software is that it takes too long to enter and manage their time. Ruddr solves this by providing multiple optimized time tracking views. Team members can use the view that best supports their style of work. Also, an auditing screen makes it simple to find and edit past time entries.• Designed for Slack. The Ruddr integration with Slack allows users to interact with Ruddr features without ever leaving Slack. Ruddr's seamless integration with Slack allows you to maximize productivity and reduce context switching.• Real-time Slack project channel alerts. Sometimes project managers forget to keep the team apprised of important project events. When project channel alerts are enabled for a project, the entire team is kept up to date on activities such as new project team members, status changes, task changes, invoice publishing, etc.• Member direct message notifications. Ruddr will notify members via a Slack direct message when it sees a potential cause for concern (such as missing time entries for the week or month).• Track vital KPIs. Ruddr provides a dashboard for each project that includes important KPIs such as realization rate, effective rate, and services margin. Additionally, Ruddr tracks organizational metrics such as billable utilization.Want to learn more?• Ruddr website. Visit us at www.ruddr.io.• Ruddr help center.

Originally designed to help software teams push quicker code reviews, it has now been re-architectured to help any type of team.No matter what role you play in any company, you will always be sharing links. It could be a Pull Request, a link to a spreadsheet that needs updating, or a business document that requires review, maybe even getting feedback on some UI/UX design mock-ups, any link will work. If you have turn-around times of 4 days, you'll see this drop to 4 hours.You can also manually create tasks and let the bot follow up for you by typing /lr.Task Reminder uses simple NLP techniques to detect when someone is asking someone to get something done. As long as you have a @username and a link in your message, our algorithm will look through the rest of the message to detect if you're asking for a review. Some ways to trigger detection:- @Bob https://example.com PTAL- @Lisa can you review this: https://example.com- @George I need a review on these mocks (https://example.com), I'm not sure if the flow makes sense on the Engineering side- @Rachel take a look at these SLAs https://example.com -- am I missing any requirements?The longer Task Reminder is a part of your team, the more it will understand your team dynamics and become more accurate. If you have a specific phrase you'd like to use, send us an email at support@labfortysix.com and we'll set you right up.Task Reminder offers a 30-day trial and uses Stripe for billing.

With the OpManager-Slack integration, you can get real-time alerts from OpManager in Slack channels and as direct messages even when you are not accessing the tool. This integration enables you to discuss troubleshooting steps with peers and make quick decisions. This integration will help IT teams to customize and simplify alert handling. You'll be able to avoid possible downtime and see a noticeable improvement in the average handling time for every network issue. Once integrated with OpManager, Slack alerts can be configured in a notification profile or as a step in a workflow task. Slack notifications for OpManager:OpManager can be configured to notify the network administrator of network faults or unmonitored devices through alarms. A notification profile can be customized to perform automatic actions based on the alarm raised, or it can simply alert the network admin who can then take corrective measures immediately. In the OpManager notifications profile, simply click on chat and configure your notifications with custom fields. Select the member or channel you want the notification to be sent to. And, that's it. Consider an example: A notification profile can be configured solely to monitor Virtual Machines. All alerts could be configured to be sent to a single channel that is dedicated to receiving these alerts. Hence all Virtual Machine alerts can be received on that channel.This applies to other network devices too. Slack and OpManager workflow tasks:Network administrators have preset, routine tasks to perform either during network faults or as ongoing maintenance tasks. These Level-1 troubleshooting steps and repetitive maintenance tasks can be automated through OpManager's powerful IT workflow automation engine. Drag and drop the \"Send Slack Message\" action to wherever necessary in the workflow. Trigger the workflow. Once the custom automation runs, users will receive a Slack notification alerting them whenever user-defined criteria in the workflow is satisfied. For example, consider having a critical server in an IT infrastructure. In order to check the status of the server periodically, you could design a workflow. Adding a Slack message to the workflow will enable you to receive immediate alerts on the state of the server.About OpManager:ManageEngine OpManager is a network management platform that helps enterprises, service providers and SMEs manage their data centers and IT infrastructure efficiently and cost effectively. Automated workflows, intelligent alerting engines, configurable discovery rules, and extendable templates enable IT teams to set up a 24/7 monitoring system within hours of installation.

Inclusive behavior is reflected in the internal and external communications of an organization and represents their values. Companies that consciously invest in inclusive communications reap accelerated gains of increase in belonging and brand loyalty (AIMM, Google, Microsoft, Facebook). Whereas, if unchecked, the cost of errors can be severe leading to high rates of attrition."},

There is no easy way to invite users in bulk. If you have tried doing it manually, we know your pain. But no more.:100: No number is big enoughHave 1000 users to bring from a different channel?

We store only the required data for the functioning of the app and store it using robust encryption algorithms. You are safe with us.Q: Can I use Channel Tools to invite external users?A: Yes, but with limited support. You can invite users from a channel shared with a different workspace in the same organization (enterprise grid plan). With the caveat, that current channel also needs to be shared with the same workspace before extending this invite. We might bake more features in our future release. Let us know using the support email address below.Q: How many users can I invite with Channel Tools?A: 1K or 10K, we can deal with any number. In fact, that's where our app shines. Come with as many as you have in your Slack channel, and we'll handle it.Q: Does /clear command delete messages from channel history?A: No. It only sends a new ephemeral message with a lot of empty lines that all the pre-existing content gets pushed up. So, all your messages are still there, safe. And you get clutter-free interface.:star2: TestimonialsSlack channel admins swear by Channel Tools as their go-to tool for sending bulk invites.Earlier, what took me an hour to do, with Channel Tools we can do it in seconds.The channel invite feature is so useful that it should have been a part of Slack itself."},

Think spell check, but for gender bias. Research shows unconscious gender bias fuels the gender gap. In order to fix this, we must all first learn to spot our biases and work against them. The Catalyst #BiasCorrect Plug-In helps speed up the learning process by flagging bias to users on Slack as it occurs and offering up bias-free alternatives, giving users a chance to consciously work against their biases in real-time. The #BiasCorrect Plug-In can:- Detect unconscious gender bias language in real-time- Privately alert the user of potential bias in their language- Allow the user to automatically correct the original message with suggested alternative language- Provide context-specific education on how to recognize gender bias in the futureStudies show that every day people across the globe send seemingly harmless messages in which female and male leaders are described very differently. These exchanges are often full of unconscious gender biases that fuel the gender gap. And because gender bias is so ingrained in society, even the most progressive among us are guilty of it—our word choices are almost automatic. The only way to correct this issue is to learn how to spot your own bias and consciously work against it. The Catalyst #BiasCorrect Plug-In helps speed up the learning process by (privately) flagging a user’s unconscious bias to them and offering up a bias-free alternative for them to consider using instead, enabling users to become a catalyst for change.Learn more at the Catalyst #BiasCorrect website."},

An inclusive team is an engaged one. An engaged team is a happy and productive one.Inclusive Bot encourages your team to use inclusive language in the workplace in a very seamless and calm way.:brain: The most advanced bot- Detects non-inclusive language based on an exclusive dictionary of thousands of expressions. And it's always growing.- Covers many categories of non-inclusive language: Gender, Race and Ethnicity, Mental Health, Sexual Orientation, Dis/Ability, Age, Microaggression, Violence, Appearance, Addiction, Socioeconomic Status, Religion...- Uses AI to understand the context of the message, to avoid being spammy.- Uses AI to detect toxic messages (containing insults, obscene, disrespectful tone of voice, NSFW...).- Suggests inclusive alternatives.- [Optional] Adds a reaction (:rainbow: by default) to the flagged message to let the team know that the user was notified.:blush: Friendly- The users are notified privately to avoid public shaming.- The user is thanked and the reaction is removed when they fix their message.- If the bot was mistaken, the user is able to report a false positive and their message will be ignored by the bot (this also helps the AI to learn and be more accurate in the future).:bar_chart: InsightfulInclusive Bot analyzes anonymously-collected data to generate reports and insights on the status of inclusive language in your workspace, and helps you determine which areas need more work.:art: CustomizableBecause not all teams are in the same phase of their journey to promote inclusive language, Inclusive Bot allows you to:- Ignore expressions: Some teams are not yet ready to give up on some expressions (industry jargon, tool names...). For that reason, you can easily tell Inclusive Bot which expressions it should stop flagging.- Add new expressions: If you think an expression is missing in our dictionary, you can easily add it.- Disable or enable some language categories.- Change or disable the reaction emoji.:office: Ready for large organizations- Inclusive Bot can analyze millions of messages a day.- Provides a Channels Management tool, which allows you to add or remove the bot from channels, in bulk.:lock: Secure and private- Inclusive Bot doesn't save your data anywhere, it analyzes the messages on the fly without storing them.- Inclusive Bot doesn't have access to your private messages, it can only read the messages posted in the channels where it has been explicitly added.What makes Inclusive Bot better than Slackbot's Custom Responses?- Inclusive Bot is powered by cutting-edge technology to make it context-aware (for example, it doesn't flag your message if you were just quoting somebody).- Gently notifies the user privately to avoid public shaming.- You don't have to maintain your list of non-inclusive language, Inclusive Bot has its own extensive dictionary which is updated regularly (it goes far beyond \"Hey guys\"/\"Hey gals\" expressions).- Inclusive Bot is a friendly bot whose goal is to create an inclusive environment, and not to punish people.- Inclusive Bot is continuously consulting DEI (Diversity, Equity, and Inclusion) leaders and activists supporting the project, the bot is just getting better over time.PricingInclusive Bot offers a 14-day free trial (contact us if you need more time) — no credit card required.After the free trial you can pick the paid plan that works best for you. See our Pricing page.SupportIf you have any questions, feedback or just want to say Hi, we will be happy to hear from you at contact@inclusivebot.comIt's worth noting that Slack does not determine what content is flagged.

DevOps developers and admins get the analytics of their OpenEBS volumes deployed across multi-cloud kubernetes clusters right into their Slack channels. Its functionality extends beyond just simply providing alerts and providing a way to query any configuration and status from Slack, It goes all the way to interact with DevOps developers and admins to manage the YAML config files in their CI/CD system.Mulebot will enhance the user's experience with the Director Online by allowing them to query the clusters’ configuration of Director Online.How this app works ?First of all, the user will install this app into his/her Slack-workspace. During installation, the user has to select a channel to post a response for slash commands and alerts. (Note : Either select a channel in which you are present or create a new channel in your workspace first and then select that channel during installation), after selecting a Slack channel and clicking on the authorize button, the user will be redirected to https://director.mayadata.io where the user has to select the clusters from the list of available clusters (one or more) to specify which cluster information user wants in his/her selected Slack channel. The user is prompted for authentication by https://director.mayadata.io if the login has not happened already.User will be able to query the selected clusters in the selected channel only. Users will not get any information outside that channel for the clusters mapped to that particular channel.Users installing the app would be able to query Director Online about the clusters they have imported in Director Online with the help of \"/maya\" slash command which would help them to get all the information by doing a single query. For example,/maya get clusters -   List all the clusters imported in                                        Director Online whether active or                                      inactive.                                                                    /maya get cluster cluster-name                              -      Fetch all the details of that particular cluster                                      whose cluster-name is provided./maya help          -      Shows the list of all the available slash                                     commands and their functionality that can                                      be used to query the bot."},
