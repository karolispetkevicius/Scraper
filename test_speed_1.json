While many biomedical researchers use Slack for their day-to-day work, there are currently no applications geared towards this field available on the Slack application directory.

GeneBot functions include: - Listening to channel communication or slash commands to trigger the posting of information about single human genes- Listening to channel communication or slash commands to trigger the posting of information about gene sets, which are analyzed via enrichment analysis or connected into networks based on their known protein-protein interactions and co-expression correlations- Serving as an education tool through a quiz that facilitates users to learn gene namesOverall, GeneBot is a Slack application that enables Slack users to perform gene centered analyses directly within Slack.
